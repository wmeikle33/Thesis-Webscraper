# Thesis Webscraper
This is my thesis code. Specificallym this code was used to collect blog post texts from the website Autohome, one of the leading sites for automobile consumers in China.The premise of my thesis is write a web scraping program that collects consumer posted blog content from Chinese websites pertaining to foreign made EV models currently available in the Chinese market. Specifically, the title of the blog post was collected, the main body content as well as the comments. I then measure how many times certain words associated with EV adoption are mentioned in this text, using the findings to generate a principal component regression vis a visa company stock returns to provide an assessmenet and general market insight of the potential of the Chinese EV market for foreign companes. This project was developed using Selenium 3.141.0. Update to Selenium 4+ requires migration of element selection methods.
