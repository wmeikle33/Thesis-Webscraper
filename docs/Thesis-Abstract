This paper collects and analyzes Chinese consumer blog postings discussing Battery Electric
Vehicles (BEV) manufactured by foreign companies for the purpose of conducting a market
analysis and providing recommendations for companies looking to enter the Chinese Electric
Vehicle (EV) market. To accomplish this, the paper utilizes a web scraping program in Python to
collect text data from the Chinese website Autohome pertaining to several different EV models
currently available in China. Once the text data is collected, the frequencies of the usages of
certain words representing factors affecting EV adoption intention are measured in each posting,
with the resulting cross-sectional data being used to conduct a principal component analysis
(PCA). The results of the PCA are used to generate indices which are run in a regression with
stock returns over the three-month period following each blog posting. The results of the
regression are then used to extrapolate key points and develop a market assessment addressing
several important issues, including the general viability of the Chinese EV market for foreign
companies, important considerations for those looking to enter the market, and suggestions for
future marketing campaigns. In general, the results of the study show that demographic and
aesthetic factors can play an especially important role in facilitating EV adoption in the Chinese
market, with monetary and market factors being relatively less important. The findings also
indicate that fake blog posts could be a threat to the viability of these studies, and that developing
a more complex algorithm to eliminate these observations could be beneficial. Other than this
practical contribution, the paper also demonstrates how web scraping programs can be used to
study this subject in the future. The use of these programs provides the opportunity for companies
to access consumersâ€™ revealed preferences presented in text information online, allowing for more
accurate market information to be collected.
